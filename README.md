# Day-Planner

In this assignment, I added a container with columns and rows to create the layout of the actual planner.

In the rows, I added a text input for the description of the day.

Next, I added the save button from the submit input.

Using moment.js, i was able to display the date at the top.

I tweaked the CSS a bit, to try and make the layout more centered and look more like the assignment demo.

The local storage is saving the word "save" and will be worked on at a later date to actually get it to save what the user inputs in the text area. 

i created a variable for the time slots for future, and present so that they change colors according to time. 

any other items left off, will be completed at a later time.
